Hello y'all

Rasi syntax is as follows:

TAG:command arg1 arg2 arg3

If there is no tag, it looks like this:

command arg1 arg2 arg3

If there are no arguments or tags it looks like this:

command

Some likely causes of problems:

- Command with tag not executing if the tag is properly set.
--- Make sure that there is no space between the colon after the tag and the command. "TAG: command" is not valid. Yes this is annoying,
--- I'm working on fixing it, but for now just do it.
- Error: User code threw an uncaught exception: ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException - length=1; index=1
---You probably forgot to provide the correct number of arguments to a command. Check to make sure they are all correct
- Rasi is running twice!!
---Make sure to only call rasiInterpreter.runRasiActually() Otherwise it will break

My Rasi is doing something weird and not on this list! Help!
