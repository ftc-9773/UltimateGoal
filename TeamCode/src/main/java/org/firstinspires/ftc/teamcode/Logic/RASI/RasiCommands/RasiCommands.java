/**
 * Class for defining functions that can be used in RASI. As of version 2.5, there is no way to
 * define functions inside a RASI file.
 *
 * //TODO Create detailed guides and documentation for RASI
 * For a detailed guide on RASI, please see RASI/guides
 *
 * The return type of the function does not matter, and it is best to leave it as void. As of version
 * 2.5, there is no way to store information in a RASI script, all variables should be contained and accessed
 * in this class.
 *
 * RASI is not case sensitive, therefore CreateRobot() and CrEaTeRoBot() will cause errors. Use whichever
 * is more readable. RASI has not been tested with conflicting function names, unknown errors may occur.
 *
 * Reserved function names and their uses:
 * - addTag      : Add the following argument as a tag for this programs execution
 * - endOpMode   : This command ends the LinearOpMode, as if the user pressed the stop button on the device
 * - removeTag   : This command removes a previously added tag from the possible tags during this programs execution.
 *      The tag can still be added back later.
 * Possible future function names. While they will cause not issues yet, they should not be used to prevent future incompatibilty
 * - addTags    : Works as addTag except that it adds all arguments as tags
 * - removeTags : Works as removeTag except that it removes all arguments from the Tag list
 * - end        : Terminates the execution of the RASI file
 *
 * Note: Rasi 2.5 is not fully backwards compatible with version 2.0. In particular, end has been replaced by endOpMode and semicolons
 * are not used as statement terminators. Statements must be written on one line, and end with a newline. Otherwise,
 * all other functions should work.
 *
 * NOTE: RASI 2.5 DOES NOT SUPPORT FUNCTIONS WITH STRING ARGUMENTS. THIS INCLUDES THE TAG MANIPULATION FUNCTIONS.
 * ----Please add documentation to the functions you create-----
 * @author cadence
 * @version 2.5
